1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:50
Preparing for the stream: Performing microphone tests, etc.: Good morning

2
00:00:50 --> 00:01:30
Morning greeting: I apologize for streaming yesterday (2025/03/27) without opening the thumbnail.

3
00:01:30 --> 00:02:00
Before starting the stream, I make sure via the browser that the thumbnail for Yamato and others is off.

4
00:02:00 --> 00:02:22
Today is 2025/03/28. Good morning.

5
00:02:22 --> 00:02:55
Yesterday (2025/03/27) I was taken by ambulance: When the paramedics asked for the date, I couldn’t answer correctly and caused confusion! I mistakenly said “the 28th”!

6
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
Setting that story aside for now, I’ll begin by putting Yamato into the pink basket.

7
00:03:00 --> 00:03:30
I changed the BGM. How is the volume balance? I plan to experiment with changing the music frequently from now on.

8
00:03:30 --> 00:04:10
Since Nico Nico Live was under maintenance yesterday, you might not know, but my stream was rough due to being down.: The archive of yesterday’s stream will be uploaded to Nico Nico Douga later.

9
00:04:10 --> 00:04:20
Now, let’s start the sugar gliders’ morning walk. The first to burst out was Yakumo; clinging to the cage is Ryu.

10
00:04:20 --> 00:04:35
Umi! Good morning! : (Yakumo) I’m Yakumo! Aunty Ao is in the neighboring cage!

11
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
Ao! Good morning! : (Ao) I’m happy when I’m petted! (Yakumo) Grandpa, that’s nice...

12
00:04:40 --> 00:04:45
(Yakumo) Master, you seem full of energy today. That’s great.

13
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
Um, that’s Umi, right? Umi! Good morning! Have a nice day!

14
00:04:50 --> 00:04:55
Who is that staring blankly out the back of the cage? Could it be Nagi?

15
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
(Nagi) I’m Nagi: (Mitsuki) There’s a young boy outside! We must respond to his appeal!

16
00:05:00 --> 00:05:15
Is Ryu showing off outside? Since Ryu is neutered, he can safely share a cage with the girls. I will catch him and put him inside.

17
00:05:15 --> 00:05:40
He’s a rather big one so although I don’t plan to feed him milk with the girls, he’ll stay with them until it’s time for the powdered milk.: (Ryu) Expressing affection to Mitsuki!

18
00:05:40 --> 00:06:50
There’s a little food left. Of course, anything inedible will be dropped onto the pet sheet. Previously I drizzled flaxseed oil with an apple flavor, but at my wife’s suggestion, I want to test sprinkling powdered milk to feed them.

19
00:06:50 --> 00:07:05
I’m using a comment viewer (OneComment). Since the connection wasn’t working well, I operated it on my PC to get it started. I’ll try my best not to misread first-time viewers’ names; please feel free to correct me if I do.

20
00:07:05 --> 00:07:15
Since there are first-time viewers, I’d like to show Ao. Ao, can you serve the first-time viewers? : (Ao) I certainly can!

21
00:07:15 --> 00:08:00
I’m using both hands for the task and filming from a little distance with a fixed stand. I’m mixing powdered milk into the food.

22
00:08:00 --> 00:08:10
Yesterday (2025/03/27), because I continued streaming with the pre-stream movie playing, my stream ended up being over 13 minutes of just my voice.: For details, please see the archive in the description.

23
00:08:10 --> 00:08:52
I tried mixing powdered milk into the food. Ao ate it. However, since he might only eat where the powdered milk is present, I’ll check later.: (Yakumo) I started eating too!

24
00:08:52 --> 00:09:25
Now, let’s start checking the cage’s cleanliness.: The scratching post needs to be washed with neutral detergent, so I’ll remove it from the cage.

25
00:09:25 --> 00:09:37
Yamato, what’s wrong? : (Umi) The master came to check if everything was okay! It wasn’t Yamato!

26
00:09:37 --> 00:10:20
On Nico Nico Live, topics like “Plans/Preparation for a New Life” are provided, so I’d like to talk about that. However, as an old man, nothing major is changing for me in April.

27
00:10:20 --> 00:10:42
A little story about my grandchild who might be starting a new life. This April, they will be in the 6th grade of elementary school. If they were to enter junior high, that would mark a new phase… but it’s hard to talk about.

28
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
(Ryu) The food with powdered milk tastes great!

29
00:10:48 --> 00:11:20
(Me) As for the scratching post and running wheel in the girls’ cage, they’re just fine.

30
00:11:20 --> 00:11:45
(Nagi) I love food with powdered milk too!

31
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
(Ao) I’m eating too!

32
00:11:48 --> 00:12:26
The others are currently jumping onto my fleece and playing. That’s Umi and Ten. Especially Umi, who darts everywhere and sometimes quickly returns to the cage—their behavior can be unpredictable.

33
00:12:26 --> 00:12:40
Umi is checking the water; if bubbles appear, it means the water dispenser is functioning and he’s drinking properly.

34
00:12:40 --> 00:13:10
That’s about it for the new life topic. I plan to continue my morning streams beyond April, but when I’m in a state like yesterday, I must take proper measures to rest.

35
00:13:10 --> 00:13:30
What happened yesterday: I streamed in the morning while suffering severe drowsiness due to lack of sleep and allergy medicine. This led to me being taken to the hospital by ambulance at noon.

36
00:13:30 --> 00:14:00
Since I have a heart condition, the ambulance ride was expedited out of concern.: After an echo, ECG, blood tests, and an abdominal X-ray, no major abnormalities were found.

37
00:14:00 --> 00:14:45
The doctor warned, “Don’t fight with your wife too much so that you don’t fall into despair.”: In the end, I did argue with my wife, resulting in sleep deprivation and unnecessary use of emergency services.

38
00:14:45 --> 00:15:10
Based on the echo, my heart appears to function at about 60% capacity. Given my age, that’s considered within the normal range.

39
00:15:10 --> 00:15:34
I had already understood from my monthly check-ups that there were no issues, but since an echo isn’t performed during routine visits, I was relieved to finally hear the results.

40
00:15:34 --> 00:16:35
Now, I’m replacing the pet sheet I couldn’t change yesterday. Today, I’m replacing the sheets in all cages.: Fortunately, none of the cages require disassembly for a full wash, so I won’t have to take them apart.

41
00:16:35 --> 00:17:32
Continuing on the topic of new life, there are many things I want to try.: For example, the BGM playing today is music I created using Suno AI.

42
00:17:32 --> 00:17:45
I’m not very good at drawing, but the sugar glider illustration I use as an icon on YouTube and Nico Nico Douga is one I drew on my iPad.

43
00:17:45 --> 00:18:18
I’ve turned my sugar glider illustration into an acrylic keychain to give to people I meet instead of handing out business cards, but there’s currently a design issue—the tail part is fragile.

44
00:18:18 --> 00:19:20
I’m considering whether to have the tail curl around me or to create a rounded background.

45
00:19:20 --> 00:19:50
If I order acrylic keychains as business cards through SUZURI or BOOTH, there’s a significant wait from ordering to delivery, so I’d like to finalize the design quickly.

46
00:19:50 --> 00:20:10
If it’s to be used as a business card, wouldn’t it be better to incorporate the “Gere no Kobo” logo somewhere? Ao, what do you think? : (Ao) I don’t know.

47
00:20:10 --> 00:20:30
Ryu, I’m sorry. I’ll feed powdered milk in the girls’ cage, so please return to the boys’ cage. I’ll close the door of the girls’ cage once.

48
00:20:30 --> 00:21:30
I have a plate that was used earlier for adding powdered milk to the food; I’ll use it to prepare powdered milk for the girls’ cage. In the upper cage, Umi, Nagi, and Mitsuki will be fed powdered milk. The rest will likely go to Yakumo.

49
00:21:30 --> 00:22:30
Since maintaining body weight is important for immunity, I manage their weight with powdered milk.: Ao and Ryu are heavy enough, so they won’t be fed powdered milk.

50
00:22:30 --> 00:22:45
At the same time, I will locate the corresponding sugar gliders and put them in the cage.

51
00:22:45 --> 00:22:55
I’ll also move the smartphone fixed stand to a spot where the feeding of powdered milk is clearly visible.

52
00:22:55 --> 00:23:25
Probably Nagi is hiding in the boys’ cage’s bed, so I plan to pull him out and feed him powdered milk.: (Mitsuki) Mom, you’ve been going on too long. (Nagi) What?!

53
00:23:25 --> 00:23:35
In the boys’ cage, Umi appears to be saying, “Can I also drink powdered milk?” so I brought him in.

54
00:23:35 --> 00:24:05
Now, I’ll close the cage door and change the pet sheet: Ideally, the pet sheet should be changed after the milk is drunk to prevent spills, but today I’m doing it at this timing.

55
00:24:05 --> 00:24:35
How does my voice sound? I thought it was very nasal yesterday. Today, I feel good.

56
00:24:35 --> 00:25:00
I believe my mental fragility shows more than my heart condition, so I want to live each day peacefully.

57
00:25:00 --> 00:25:58
There are quite a few viewers at this time, which makes me happy. There are also people watching on Nico Nico Live. I’m just glad if they can enjoy watching the sugar gliders without commenting. However, if there’s any problem with the sound or video, please let me know in the comments.

58
00:25:58 --> 00:26:12
Unless there’s an unavoidable technical issue, I can move the camera to capture the sugar gliders.

59
00:26:12 --> 00:26:23
Ah, we’re out of powdered milk. I’ll prepare some new powdered milk.: (Nagi & Mitsuki) Master, you’ve been going on too long. Didn’t we finish the powdered milk already?

60
00:26:23 --> 00:26:35
The two girls exchanged looks when they realized the powdered milk was gone.

61
00:26:35 --> 00:27:10
I have scheduled a 30-minute morning walk for the sugar gliders in the upper cage and another 30 minutes for those in the lower cage: The “lower cage” refers to the two cages beneath the current one in this multi-tier setup.

62
00:27:10 --> 00:27:35
After finishing the powdered milk setup in the current cage, I will conclude the upper cage’s morning walk and start the lower cage’s walk.

63
00:27:35 --> 00:27:50
Ryu, please return to the boys’ cage.: (Ryu) Why on earth—?!

64
00:27:50 --> 00:28:10
(Mitsuki) Why did our husband go back to the neighboring cage?

65
00:28:10 --> 00:28:32
I’ll work off-camera for a bit. I apologize if the mess from sugar glider towels and food remains is captured.

66
00:28:32 --> 00:28:37
I managed to catch Ten. Let’s go back to the cage.

67
00:28:37 --> 00:28:47
I need to trim the sugar gliders’ nails with my wife’s help.

68
00:28:47 --> 00:28:56
The powdered milk didn’t cool enough and was hot; Nagi is shaking his head vigorously, showing it’s hard to drink.

69
00:28:56 --> 00:29:19
Just like the audio in the recent short video “I Made a Song Like ‘Eho Eho’”, sugar gliders, like other animals, have sensitive tongues.: I also made a short video using that audio—please check the description if interested.

70
00:29:19 --> 00:29:51
I’ll do a headcount and finish the upper cage’s morning walk: At a glance, it seems Yakumo hasn’t returned yet.

71
00:29:51 --> 00:30:30
Lately, the morning walk for the girls in the lower cage often starts first: However, before that, I’ll take Yamato out of the basket and put Ten into the pink basket.

72
00:30:30 --> 00:31:05
Sometimes Ten gets into fights with the boys in the lower cage, and if one of them exits first by accident, Ten might get hurt or hurt someone.

73
00:31:05 --> 00:32:05
I managed to get Ten back into the basket, so I will send out the girls from the lower cage: Since Yakumo in the upper cage is male, he hardly ever fights with the girls in the lower cage.

74
00:32:05 --> 00:32:42
Some are playing around the fixed smartphone stand, so be careful as the smartphone might be knocked off, the mute button pressed, or the stream stopped.

75
00:32:42 --> 00:32:50
Once Yakumo is spotted, I’ll catch him and start the morning walk for the boys in the lower cage on camera.

76
00:32:50 --> 00:33:20
I’ll start cleaning the girls’ cage: I plan to add powdered milk to the food and change the pet sheet, and the scratching post and running wheel seem fine.

77
00:33:20 --> 00:33:50
The pet sheet is dirtier than usual because I couldn’t change it yesterday.

78
00:33:50 --> 00:34:23
Since sugar gliders are nocturnal, cleaning in the morning is least stressful and keeps the cage clean until night.

79
00:34:23 --> 00:34:45
The boys are practically pleading to get out of the cage.

80
00:34:45 --> 00:35:25
Answering a question from Nico Nico Live comments: I’m currently letting them out for a walk. They’re accustomed enough to humans that when caught, they don’t thrash much. Also, I walk the males and females separately.

81
00:35:25 --> 00:35:55
I’m using one camera, but apparently Nico Nico Live only starts acquiring comments after the stream begins, so it’s a bit challenging: (Shiro & Tsukushi) I don’t know.

82
00:35:55 --> 00:36:30
Yakumo still hasn’t been found. I’m checking off-camera to see if he’s in the upper cage.

83
00:36:30 --> 00:36:42
While searching for Yakumo, I peeked into the upper cage and saw they were tired of drinking powdered milk, so I brought a plate of powdered milk to the lower cage.

84
00:36:42 --> 00:37:18
Now, I’ll start feeding the girls in the lower cage with powdered milk: Shiro, can you have some milk?

85
00:37:18 --> 00:37:34
Since the sugar gliders are drinking far from the smartphone, I’ll move it to capture their drinking behavior.

86
00:37:34 --> 00:38:05
I also want to feed the other girls powdered milk, so I plan to find them and put them in the cage.: However, I won’t force those who show no interest.

87
00:38:05 --> 00:38:40
I managed to catch Tsukushi and will try feeding her powdered milk.: (Tsukushi) I have nowhere to drink from!

88
00:38:40 --> 00:38:52
There are other sugar gliders I want to feed as well, so I’ll prepare a new plate of powdered milk and put it in the cage.

89
00:38:52 --> 00:39:30
Sugar gliders don’t struggle too much when caught because they’re quite accustomed to humans. Especially the babies tend to be rambunctious.: If you search “Sugar Glider Tame,” you might see how challenging it is.

90
00:39:30 --> 00:40:10
The microphone isn’t picking it up, but a fight has broken out somewhere.: (Shiro) I’m going to start a fight because the powdered milk is gone.

91
00:40:10 --> 00:40:30
If Yakumo isn’t found, the boys in the lower cage won’t be able to go for a walk. That’s a problem.

92
00:40:30 --> 00:41:00
Yamato in the boys’ cage has been losing weight drastically, so I’ll move him to the girls’ cage, close the door, and let him drink milk.

93
00:41:00 --> 00:42:05
While continuing the search for Yakumo, I found one that looked like him—but it turned out to be Tsukushi.: Since Tsukushi is female and I want to feed her powdered milk, she will be placed in the girls’ cage.

94
00:42:05 --> 00:42:40
I embarked on a little journey to search for Yakumo: I looked off-camera, far away. I managed to catch him, but he was thrashing so much that I couldn’t show him.

95
00:42:40 --> 00:43:05
I placed Yakumo in the upper cage and simultaneously freed Ten from the pink basket. This concludes the upper cage’s morning walk.: Yamato is quietly drinking powdered milk.

96
00:43:05 --> 00:44:10
Now, I’ll begin the morning walk for the boys in the lower cage. Their food is also leftover, so I’ll drizzle apple-flavored flaxseed oil to make it easier to eat.

97
00:44:10 --> 00:44:30
I’m showing the boys’ cage. I’ll introduce the food with apple-flavored flaxseed oil and demonstrate the cleanliness check.: I apologize for the somewhat messy images.

98
00:44:30 --> 00:44:37
The boys ate the food with the flaxseed oil.

99
00:44:37 --> 00:45:00
Now, I’ll set the smartphone on a fixed stand and change the pet sheet in the lower cage: The footage shows Ao and the others eating in the upper cage.

100
00:45:00 --> 00:45:40
The reason I rushed with the sugar gliders’ morning walk is that they tend to fall asleep after 8 o’clock.

101
00:45:40 --> 00:46:05
I hope to finish cleaning by the time the sugar gliders are awake.

102
00:46:05 --> 00:46:25
For the Nico Nico Live segment, I tagged the stream with “talking about new life.” Although I might change the method or equipment, I believe the techniques for the morning walk and cleaning will remain the same.

103
00:46:25 --> 00:47:05
I plan to gradually improve the streaming environment by adding equipment like a StreamDeck and extra cameras.: Also, I aim to improve the sugar glider cage itself. That’s one of my goals! (Sou) I don’t know!

104
00:47:05 --> 00:47:21
After one more powdered milk change in the girls’ cage, I will conclude the morning walk on this main stream.: The container was empty.

105
00:47:21 --> 00:48:20
After the walk, I’ll have snack time.: Having snack time signals the end of the walk and serves as training for them to return from the walk.

106
00:48:20 --> 00:49:00
Before snack time, I’ll search for Shiro and Hayate who haven’t returned from the walk.: The other sugar gliders are in the cage and the door is closed.

107
00:49:00 --> 00:49:50
It’s currently 7:50. I plan to end the stream in about 10 minutes, so I’ll hurry to find Shiro and Hayate.: However, those two always escape, so they’re hard to catch.

108
00:49:50 --> 00:50:40
When I called out “Hey, it’s nearly snack time, come out!” Shiro appeared and I caught him.: I apologize for catching him off-camera. I only showed a brief glimpse of the powdered milk feeding.

109
00:50:40 --> 00:51:00
There was a slight noise, so I went to look for Hayate.

110
00:51:00 --> 00:51:30
“Hayate, Hayate, come out, come out, you’re out—caught!”: (Hayate) Caught!

111
00:51:30 --> 00:52:00
Thus, I managed to catch all the sugar gliders and will now prepare for snack time.: Today is a peaceful day.

112
00:52:00 --> 00:52:30
For a snack today, I’m thinking of serving yogurt drops. They’re made from additive-free yogurt solidified like candy— a favorite of sugar gliders who love sweets.

113
00:52:30 --> 00:53:00
Today, since everyone is back in the cage, I quietly announce snack time. Some are already asleep.

114
00:53:00 --> 00:54:45
As soon as I call for snack time, everyone rushes in a survival-of-the-fittest manner. However, it seems that not many take others’ snacks, as they understand to prepare their own portion.

115
00:54:45 --> 00:57:30
Closing remarks: Thank you for watching. : Ending – The sugar glider is with Sou!
