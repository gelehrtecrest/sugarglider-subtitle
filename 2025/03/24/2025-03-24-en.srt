00:00:00 --> 00:02:00
[Preparing for the Stream]
I am getting ready for the stream. As usual, the audio on YouTube is not coming through well, so I intend to review the microphone settings in OBS.

2
00:02:00 --> 00:03:20
[Morning Greeting]
I greet with “Good morning.” Since the recording is working properly at the moment, I expect that the audio will be considerably improved when the archive is re-uploaded.

3
00:03:20 --> 00:04:00
I begin the task of putting Yamato, the sugar glider, into the pink basket.

4
00:04:00 --> 00:05:20
I am still not accustomed to using OBS, and I feel a bit confused.

5
00:05:20 --> 00:05:35
Well then, I’m going to start the morning walk for the sugar gliders in the upper cage.

6
00:05:35 --> 00:05:50
(Yakumo) Yakumo shouts, “Breakfast is important too!”

7
00:05:50 --> 00:06:20
(Mitsuki) Mitsuki says, “I’m also eating the leftover food.”

8
00:06:20 --> 00:06:35
(Ryuu) Ryuu remarks, “I think I’m going to go play.”

9
00:06:35 --> 00:06:55
I intend to check the dirt inside the cage.

10
00:06:55 --> 00:07:10
I find that the scratching post is very dirty, so I remove it and wash it with a neutral detergent.

11
00:07:10 --> 00:08:00
I will give one part of the cage a thorough cleaning (this is done off-stream). Meanwhile, on-stream I plan to show the skinny sugar glider drinking powdered milk.

12
00:08:00 --> 00:08:20
As far as I know, sugar gliders are nocturnal. Even in the morning, I greet them by saying, “You’re still sleepy, aren’t you?”

13
00:08:20 --> 00:08:50
In this room, I was using an oil heater for winter measures until recently, but I am now using an air conditioner.

14
00:08:50 --> 00:09:10
I work on multiple tasks simultaneously. First, I prepare powdered milk for the female cage and let the sugar gliders drink it. At the same time, I carry out a wipe-down cleaning and change the pet sheets.

15
00:09:10 --> 00:09:25
Previously, I posted a video titled “Not Eating Cucumber Peels,” but this time, since the sugar gliders also leave tomato peels uneaten, I pick them off and dispose of them in the trash.

16
00:09:25 --> 00:10:15
The food for the male cage is for weight loss, so as the owner, I dispose of only the parts that they cannot eat, leaving the rest in the male cage.

17
00:10:15 --> 00:11:30
I place my smartphone on a fixed stand and bring over the container and other items needed for giving them powdered milk from the adjacent room.

18
00:11:30 --> 00:12:00
Afterwards, I return to the room and bring a small glass dish, a small ceramic dish, and a spoon from the kitchen.

19
00:12:00 --> 00:12:50
The sugar gliders in the female cage are so hungry that they ate all the food I prepared last night, so I make powdered milk in a large-capacity ceramic dish and put it inside the female cage.

20
00:12:50 --> 00:13:00
I apologize, but there are no sugar gliders visible on the stream at the moment as I am working off-camera.

21
00:13:00 --> 00:13:30
Since I am participating in a streaming project on Niconico Live with the theme “Hanami” (cherry blossom viewing), I will also talk a little about “Sugar Gliders and Hanami.”

22
00:13:30 --> 00:14:00
In the park near my home, the cherry blossoms bloom. As an annual tradition, I take a few sugar gliders with me and show the ones who have never seen cherry blossoms what they look like.

23
00:14:00 --> 00:15:30
I have a bittersweet memory. When I tried to take photos of the cherry blossoms, I brought a sugar glider close to a cherry tree, and it climbed up the tree and wouldn’t come down. Eventually, with the help of many people, I rescued that sugar glider. By the way, that sugar glider is Aoo, the elder.

24
00:15:30 --> 00:15:40
Since that incident, I have made sure not to let my sugar gliders climb cherry trees.

25
00:15:40 --> 00:16:00
In Japan, there are frequent incidents where sugar gliders escape from parks and have to be rescued. As an owner, I must be careful to prevent such dangerous situations.

26
00:16:00 --> 00:16:35
I also want Umi to have some milk, so I plan to find Umi in the male cage and bring it to the spot with the milk in the female cage.

27
00:16:35 --> 00:16:45
I carry out the task of feeding milk and, at the same time, change the pet sheets.

28
00:16:45 --> 00:18:00
Even the sugar gliders that don’t need to be fed milk seem to be searching for the source by sniffing the milk scent.

29
00:18:00 --> 00:18:30
I place my smartphone on a fixed stand and begin changing the pet sheets.

30
00:18:30 --> 00:19:00
Today is Monday. In my area, it is the day for burning trash, so I must change the pet sheets early and take them to the trash collection site in the morning.

31
00:19:00 --> 00:19:30
I will work on simplifying and streamlining my tasks wherever possible.

32
00:19:30 --> 00:20:35
In my experience, the audio quality is better and the stream runs more smoothly on Niconico Live. Since I use N Air on Niconico Live and OBS on YouTube, I plan to review the OBS settings to prepare for tomorrow’s stream.

33
00:20:35 --> 00:20:50
Currently, there are no sugar gliders visible on the stream. So, I plan to move the smartphone to ensure that the sugar gliders appear on camera.

34
00:20:50 --> 00:22:30
I move the camera to show the sugar glider drinking powdered milk. At the moment, only one sugar glider is drinking milk, while the others seem to have already eaten their fill.

35
00:22:30 --> 00:22:45
(Yakumo) Yakumo shouts, “Hey, pay attention to me too, master! I want some milk too!”

36
00:22:45 --> 00:23:05
I note that since Yakumo is a baby and in its growth phase, I want to make sure it gets plenty of milk.

37
00:23:05 --> 00:23:45
Once all the sugar gliders that need to drink milk have gathered in the female cage, I decide to close the cage door for the time being.

38
00:23:45 --> 00:25:38
I have other memories of hanami as well. Since cherry blossoms bloom in the park near my home, I take 2–3 sugar gliders who have never seen cherry blossoms and let them experience the scent and appearance of the blossoms. However, since the sugar gliders themselves are not particularly interested in cherry blossoms, this is just our (the owners’) whim.

39
00:25:38 --> 00:26:00
I show the sugar gliders to other people who come to the hanami and introduce their charms.

40
00:26:00 --> 00:26:25
(Ten) Ten asks, “Aren’t you all going for a walk?”

41
00:26:25 --> 00:27:00
Since I cannot find Ryuu, who is supposed to be taking a walk inside the room, I decide to search for him for a while.

42
00:27:00 --> 00:27:45
The mini tomatoes I gave last night have only their peels left neatly. Previously, when I gave cucumbers, only the peels were left as well. I have made short videos and photos available in the description.

43
00:27:45 --> 00:28:30
I have found Ryuu. Once I finish the wipe-down cleaning, I will end the morning walk in the upper cage.

44
00:28:30 --> 00:29:15
Since the cleaning of the upper cage is complete, I now begin the task of returning the sugar gliders in that cage back to their original cage.

45
00:29:15 --> 00:30:50
Since Nagi, one of the females, is likely hiding in the male cage, I search for Nagi and return her to the female cage.

46
00:30:50 --> 00:31:20
Because I couldn’t find the sleeping area in the female cage, I temporarily place a pouch that can be used as a bed inside the cage.

47
00:31:20 --> 00:32:20
Furthermore, since I haven’t yet caught Ten, I carry out the task of catching Ten and putting him in the male cage.

48
00:32:20 --> 00:33:00
While I was placing Ten into the male cage, I found the sleeping area in the female cage and installed it. During that process, Ten came out from the back of the cage, and I managed to catch him.

49
00:33:00 --> 00:33:30
I removed Yamato from the pink basket and placed Ten into it. Please note that this work was done off-camera.

50
00:33:30 --> 00:34:25
I continue talking about hanami. I try to do hanami every year, and since Yakumo and Tsukushi have not yet seen the cherry blossoms, I want to show them the blossoms.

51
00:34:25 --> 00:34:35
Shiro, one of the females in the lower cage, is sticking its head into the basket placed on the walking path.

52
00:34:35 --> 00:34:50
The sugar glider on my shoulder is Rin, a female, playing on my shirt.

53
00:34:50 --> 00:35:03
Since I had not yet opened the door of the male cage, I open it and start the walk for Sou and Hayate.

54
00:35:03 --> 00:35:15
Tsukushi is still inside the female cage and does not seem to be going out for a walk.

55
00:35:15 --> 00:35:40
Because Yamato spent the night in the female cage, there is leftover food in the male cage. I move the food from the male cage to the female cage and leave only the edible parts.

56
00:35:40 --> 00:36:00
I prepare powdered milk for the female cage and have Yamato and the other females drink it.

57
00:36:00 --> 00:37:00
Right now, Yamato is fighting. Possibly due to too much exercise, his weight has decreased, so I plan to increase his weight with milk.

58
00:37:00 --> 00:38:00
I suffer from hay fever, so when I go hanami, my eyes itch and I get a runny nose, although I do not experience severe allergic reactions. I have received medication for hay fever from an ENT specialist.

59
00:38:00 --> 00:39:00
I discovered Sou in a basket along the walking path. Sou is Yamato’s son and is staring down at Yakumo, who is in the upper cage.

60
00:39:00 --> 00:39:50
With the help of my wife, I am preparing the powdered milk.

61
00:39:50 --> 00:40:15
I can hear the sugar gliders screaming, but since it is more like a minor scuffle than an actual fight, I, as the owner, do not intervene.

62
00:40:15 --> 00:40:35
I continue the task of feeding powdered milk off-camera. Shortly, I will show on camera the sugar gliders drinking the milk.

63
00:40:35 --> 00:41:30
Now, I will show footage of the sugar gliders drinking powdered milk. Yamato, Rin, and Tsukushi are drinking it. Later, I will take the cage out, disassemble it, and wash it with neutral detergent.

64
00:41:30 --> 00:43:00
I begin cleaning the lower cage. Since I gave them tomatoes yesterday, I dispose of any leftover food remains. As for the male cage, after checking the level of dirt, it appears that simply changing the pet sheets is sufficient.

65
00:43:00 --> 00:44:00
I move the fixed stand and capture footage of a sugar glider drinking powdered milk from afar.

66
00:44:00 --> 00:46:50
As a new initiative on YouTube, I have started adding subtitles in Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean from the video dated 2025/03/22. Please forgive any errors in the English, Chinese, or Korean subtitles as they are produced using machine translation.

67
00:46:50 --> 00:47:40
I check the powdered milk consumption in each cage. In the lower cage, one small dish of powdered milk has been emptied, and in the upper cage, the sugar gliders seem to have grown tired of drinking milk. Also, Umi is desperately trying to escape, but if Umi escapes, a fight will break out between Sou and Hayate, so I am keeping Umi contained.

68
00:47:40 --> 00:49:10
I felt that there wasn’t enough powdered milk in the lower cage, so I make an additional batch.

69
00:49:10 --> 00:50:20
Perhaps because my body smells of powdered milk, several sugar gliders are clinging to me. I apologize and explain that I cannot feed them any milk.

70
00:50:20 --> 00:50:38
Rin is drinking powdered milk, and Tsukushi is about to go for a walk. Since Tsukushi is at a healthy weight, there is no issue, but I am relieved that Rin is drinking milk because I worry about her weight loss. I’m also happy that Yamato is drinking powdered milk.

71
00:50:38 --> 00:51:00
I notice that Sou is rummaging around near the basket where snacks are kept. Since Sou is smart enough to open the snack bag, I catch him.

72
00:51:00 --> 00:51:20
I now begin the process of ending the morning walk in the lower cage.

73
00:51:20 --> 00:51:40
In the female cage, three sugar gliders are drinking powdered milk. Rin shouts at Tsukushi, “This powdered milk is mine!” while playfully tapping Tsukushi.

74
00:51:40 --> 00:52:00
Since Yamato is fully focused on drinking powdered milk, I take Ten out from the pink basket in the upper cage and give him to him.

75
00:52:00 --> 00:55:00
Because I am concerned about the audio quality on YouTube, I review the OBS settings once again. However, I couldn’t fix it properly at that time, so I decided to readjust after the stream. If anyone has any recommendations for settings, I would appreciate your advice.

76
00:55:00 --> 00:55:20
I want to get Ten out of the pink basket as quickly as possible.

77
00:55:20 --> 00:55:40
Also, the audio of the videos recorded on my PC is clear, so when I re-upload the video as a widescreen version, the audio will be crisp.

78
00:55:40 --> 00:57:08
I check the number of sugar gliders and conclude the morning walk. I am aware that Shiro is still out walking.

79
00:57:08 --> 00:58:40
Since the powdered milk I put in the lower cage has gone unused, I move it to the female cage in the upper section so that it can be eaten for lunch.

80
00:58:40 --> 01:00:00
I was unable to find Tsumugi, so I plan to look for Tsumugi after the stream.

81
01:00:00 --> 01:01:20
I begin preparing for snack time. I initially planned to give crispy cheese, but since I don’t have enough stock, I decided to give marshmallows instead.

82
01:01:20 --> 01:03:28
I issue the call for snack time. I ask those watching with earphones or headphones to adjust the volume accordingly. Although I issued the call, Tsumugi has yet to appear.

83
01:03:28 --> 01:05:45
Finally, I give my closing remarks. Thank you very much for watching. If you don’t mind, please subscribe, give a high rating, follow, and like the video. The sugar glider visible during the closing is Yakumo. I say, “See you again tomorrow at 7 o’clock.”
