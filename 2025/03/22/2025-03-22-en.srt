0:00 –> 1:30
Preparing for the stream.

1:30 –> 2:10
Starting with the morning greeting: "Good morning!"

2:10 –> 4:10
While trying to put Yamato into the pink basket, Hayate managed to escape. So instead, I put Ten in the basket and started the morning walk from the lower cage.

4:10 –>
After weighing them, I found that Nagi, Mitsuki, and Yamato had lost some weight. For more details, please check the short videos and horizontal videos linked in the description.

6:40 –>
Talking about washing the fleece. For more details, please refer to the previous day's archived stream in the description.

7:10 –>
(Ao) "Why is my grandchild already in the pink basket so early? I can't eat my food like this..."

8:05 –>
Checking the dirtiness of the lower cage. Since I have plans to go to the vet this morning, I won't be sun-drying the cage today.

9:45 –>
Starting to replace the pet sheets in the lower cage.

11:45 –>
(Upper cage kids) "Why aren't we the ones going for the morning walk first!?"

12:20 –>
(Tsukushi) "I'm Tsukushi! Don't misread my name!"

12:48 –>
Rin, Yamato, and Tsumugi were gathered around this basket area.

13:20 –>
When I pointed the camera at the upper cage, a fight broke out between the lower cage kids and the upper cage kids.

14:35 –>
Both sides continued to stare each other down. I placed the baskets at just the right distance to maintain this kind of standoff. That way, they won’t cling to the bars and start unnecessary fights.

15:30 –>
Off-screen, I am sorting through the food dish, keeping only the edible parts and throwing away the inedible parts onto the pet sheet. Since sugar gliders can be picky eaters, I add a sweet scent to make the food more appealing.
