1
00:0:00 --> 00:1:30
I'm getting ready for the stream.

2
00:1:30 --> 00:2:10
I greet everyone with a morning "Good morning!"

3
00:2:10 --> 00:4:10
While I was busy putting Yamato into the pink basket, Hayate escaped. So, I put Ten into the pink basket instead and started the morning walk with the sugar glider from the lower cage.

4
00:4:10 --> 00:6:40
After weighing them, I found that several sugar gliders (Nagi, Mitsuki, Yamato) had lost weight. For more details, please check the short video or the wide-format video linked in the description.

5
00:6:40 --> 00:7:10
I washed the fleece. For more details, please refer to yesterday’s archive in the description.

6
00:7:10 --> 00:8:05
(Ao) "Why is our grandchild already in the pink basket? He won't be able to eat!"

7
00:8:05 --> 00:9:45
I checked the dirt in the lower cage. Since I have a hospital appointment this morning, I won't be sun-drying the cage today.

8
00:9:45 --> 00:11:45
I started replacing the pet sheet in the lower cage.

9
00:11:45 --> 00:12:20
(The sugar gliders in the upper cage) "Why is our morning walk being postponed?!"

10
00:12:20 --> 00:12:48
(Tsukushi) "I'm Tsukushi! Don't get my name wrong!"

11
00:12:48 --> 00:13:20
Rin, Yamato, and Tsumugi gathered around this basket.

12
00:13:20 --> 00:14:35
When I showed the upper cage on camera, a fight broke out between the sugar gliders in the lower and upper cages.

13
00:14:35 --> 00:15:30
I observed as they continued glaring at each other. I placed the basket at a distance where they would only exchange glares. That way, it prevents them from clinging to the bars and getting into unnecessary fights.

14
00:15:30 --> 00:17:35
Off-screen, I worked on discarding the inedible parts from the food dish onto a pet sheet while leaving the edible parts. Since the sugar gliders have their likes and dislikes, I added a sweet aroma.

15
00:17:35 --> 00:18:10
(Yamato) "The master’s explanation is so long!"
(Ao) "The master is explaining! Sit down and listen!"

16
00:18:10 --> 00:18:45
Since the fighting hasn’t gotten too intense, I’m not interfering much. There are even sugar gliders rubbing their bottoms as a form of territorial dispute.

17
00:18:45 --> 00:19:15
I placed a microphone in the spare cage. Shiro seems bothered by the flashing light of the microphone.
(Shiro) "I'm curious! Hmm, can I chew it?"

18
00:19:15 --> 00:20:00
Who is the sugar glider taking care of my hair right now? …Ah, it’s Sou!

19
00:20:00 --> 00:20:35
I’m filming the entire cage.

20
00:20:35 --> 00:21:00
I added a fruity aroma to the remaining food. Then, Yamato began eating. I'm very happy because Yamato, the sugar glider who had lost weight, is now eating.

21
00:21:00 --> 00:21:48
I’m filming each sugar glider during their walk.

22
00:21:48 --> 00:22:50
I resumed the cleaning work.

23
00:22:50 --> 00:23:35
Since Yamato was eating so diligently, I closed the cage door. Then, I took Ten out of the pink basket.

24
00:23:35 --> 00:25:20
Today, since my wife and I have to go to the hospital, I’ll wrap up the tasks early. I will also catch the sugar gliders that are out for a walk.

25
00:25:20 --> 00:26:00
Since Shiro had entered the boy’s cage, I moved him to the girl’s cage.
(Shiro) "I like young boys!"

26
00:26:00 --> 00:26:50
I returned all the sugar gliders from the lower cage back into their cage. Next, I put Yamato into the pink basket to take the sugar gliders in the upper cage for a walk. This is to prevent Yamato from fighting with the sugar gliders in the upper cage.

27
00:26:50 --> 00:27:10
I began the morning walk for the sugar gliders in the upper cage.

28
00:27:10 --> 00:27:30
All the sugar gliders in the currently filmed cage are showing a tendency to lose weight. Therefore, I put in extra food, but there still seems to be a little left over.

29
00:27:30 --> 00:27:50
Yakumo, the baby sugar glider in the adjacent cage, is steadily gaining weight.

30
00:27:50 --> 00:28:10
I really want Umi to eat too, but Umi is out for a walk and is currently hiding inside my fleece.

31
00:28:10 --> 00:29:30
I’m filming each sugar glider’s walk.

32
00:29:30 --> 00:30:35
I checked the dirt in the cage and identified the spots that need cleaning. Since the cage with the girl sugar gliders is dirtier, I proceeded with wiping it down.

33
00:30:35 --> 00:32:20
I stepped out to clean off-camera, so on camera, I’m showing Ao having his meal.

34
00:32:20 --> 00:34:10
The current stream is being broadcast simultaneously on both YouTube and Niconico Live.

35
00:34:10 --> 00:35:30
Since “Niconico Live Cruise” dropped by, I briefly explained the main broadcast.

36
00:35:30 --> 00:38:00
I resumed my work. Also, I received some candid feedback from the viewers who joined from the cruise. Such honest opinions are a valuable reference to improve the broadcast.

37
00:38:00 --> 00:38:40
Right now, the sugar gliders in the upper cage are taking a “room walk” inside the room, flying here and there. Once the cleaning is finished, I plan to film their activity.

38
00:38:40 --> 00:39:20
I briefly filmed a sugar glider that jumped at me.

39
00:39:20 --> 00:40:20
Since more sugar gliders are getting tired from the walk, I started bringing them back into the cage one by one.

40
00:40:20 --> 00:41:30
I searched for the sugar gliders that I hadn’t found yet, and also took Yamato out of the pink basket.

41
00:41:30 --> 00:42:00
I took Yamato out of the pink basket, and since my wife caught Yakumo, I returned the little one to the cage.

42
00:42:00 --> 00:43:30
Once I finished looking for the remaining girl sugar gliders, Nagi and Mitsuki, I confirmed that all the sugar gliders had returned.

43
00:43:30 --> 00:44:35
I discovered Nagi in the boy’s cage.
(Nagi) "I want to be surrounded by boys too, you know."

44
00:44:35 --> 00:46:00
After confirming that everyone had returned, I decided it was time for “Snack Time.” Today’s snack is cheese.

45
00:46:00 --> 00:46:20
Normally, I announce “Snack Time” in a loud voice, but since no sugar gliders are hiding today, I announced it softly.

46
00:46:20 --> 00:48:25
I conducted “Snack Time.”

47
00:48:25 --> 00:50:36
I gave my closing remarks for the stream. The last sugar gliders I introduced today were “Tsukushi” and “Tsumugi.” After this, I played the ending video.
