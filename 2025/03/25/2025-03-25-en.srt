1
00:00:00 --> 00:01:00
Preparing for the stream: Good morning.

2
00:01:00 --> 00:01:24
Stream greeting: I reviewed the OBS settings yesterday, but can you hear my voice clearly?

3
00:01:24 --> 00:02:00
I removed the towel that was darkening the cage and now I'm showing the sugar glider. I’m also noticing that the pet sheet is very soiled.

4
00:02:00 --> 00:02:30
Now, I’ll start the sugar glider morning walk and cage maintenance. First, I’ll isolate Yamato from the lower cage by putting him in the pink basket.

5
00:02:30 --> 00:02:50
I’m placing the smartphone on a fixed stand and working off-screen.

6
00:02:50 --> 00:03:12
Was the YouTube audio alright yesterday? I reviewed the OBS settings for the stream yesterday, and based on the archive, the sound seems to be working quite normally.

7
00:03:12 --> 00:03:25
Since Yamato has been successfully isolated in the pink basket, I’ll now begin the morning walk for the sugar gliders in the upper cage.

8
00:03:25 --> 00:03:40
(Ao) I guess I don’t need to walk today.

9
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
(Yakumo) I’ll leave after I have a bit more food.

10
00:03:45 --> 00:03:55
(Umi) I want to go out quickly! Open the door!

11
00:03:55 --> 00:04:05
(Ten) I’m going to go visit my owner!

12
00:04:05 --> 00:04:25
I checked on Nagi and Mitsuki, and it seems the two girls are already sleepy. Mitsuki even winked at me.

13
00:04:25 --> 00:04:40
First, I’d like to check the cleanliness inside the cage.

14
00:04:40 --> 00:05:00
The perch in the male cage is dirty, so it looks like it needs a good wipe-down.

15
00:05:00 --> 00:05:30
I’m now preparing for cleaning. At the same time, since I’ve been giving powder milk to the girls and the underweight male to help them gain weight, I’ll also prepare to make the powder milk.

16
00:05:30 --> 00:05:52
Until yesterday I had to go to the kitchen for the small plates and tools needed for making the powder milk, but today I’ve prepared the small plates and spoons in advance.

17
00:05:52 --> 00:06:10
Umi is drinking water. This is a water drinking check—if bubbles form in the water dispenser, it shows Umi is drinking properly and that the dispenser is working. However, Umi didn’t really show a proper drinking moment.

18
00:06:10 --> 00:06:30
Now, I’ll place the smartphone on the fixed stand and begin working. I’m doing some work on my PC and have launched a comment viewer (OneComment).

19
00:06:30 --> 00:07:35
Regarding the OBS settings I reviewed yesterday, I suspect that the microphone sensitivity was too high, which distorted the sound. My voice might not be coming through as well, but based on the archive, everything seems fine.

20
00:07:35 --> 00:08:10
This is the process of making the powder milk. I’m pouring hot water and cold water into this dish using a water dispenser to make the milk.

21
00:08:10 --> 00:08:30
While making the powder milk, Yakumo jumped onto the counter. Since Yakumo is still a baby, it’s important for him to gain weight.

22
00:08:30 --> 00:08:55
I don’t want Ao, Ryu, or Ten to gain weight—if they do, I’d have to put them on a diet again. In the upper cage, only Yakumo and Umi are allowed to have milk.

23
00:08:55 --> 00:09:10
When I placed the milk in the girls’ cage, Nagi and Mitsuki reacted a bit by coming out of their sleeping area.

24
00:09:10 --> 00:09:27
I’ve started giving the girls the powder milk. Umi seems interested too, so I’m taking him along.

25
00:09:27 --> 00:09:35
Umi, Nagi, and Mitsuki are now having only milk. They’re so cute.

26
00:09:35 --> 00:09:45
Ryu is drinking water from the dispenser—another water drinking check.

27
00:09:45 --> 00:09:52
Since I don’t need to give milk to the others right now, I’ll close the door on the cage where the milk is placed.

28
00:09:52 --> 00:10:25
Next, I’ll clean the perch.

29
00:10:25 --> 00:10:40
I have to go to the hospital this morning, so I won’t be disassembling the cage to wash it with a neutral detergent.

30
00:10:40 --> 00:11:35
For the rest of the cleaning, I’ll remove only the edible parts from the dish that held their food—dropping the inedible bits onto the pet sheet—and then replace the pet sheet.

31
00:11:35 --> 00:12:40
In Japan, students are on spring break. The word “spring break” itself brings back nostalgic memories for me—I’ve forgotten so much about my student days.

32
00:12:40 --> 00:13:45
I suffer a bit from hay fever, so I apologize if any sounds are unpleasant. I’ve been prescribed medication by an ENT doctor, and I’m managing my itchy eyes with eye drops.

33
00:13:45 --> 00:14:28
The sugar gliders, attracted by the smartphone, have gathered around. The microphone is sparkling, and Yakumo, who’s confined in the cage, is very curious.

34
00:14:28 --> 00:15:00
Since the dish of powder milk I gave to the girls is now empty, I’ll make more powder milk and add it.

35
00:15:00 --> 00:15:25
After giving them powder milk for a few days, I plan to measure their weight again—I don’t want them to gain too much and risk diabetes.

36
00:15:25 --> 00:15:45
“Just a little, Ten—stay in this cage. Umi, Nagi, and Mitsuki, please return your plates for now. I’m going to make a fresh batch of powder milk.”

37
00:15:45 --> 00:16:10
“You all can go for a walk while I remake the powder milk, okay? Aren’t you going for a walk? (Nagi, Mitsuki) We’re waiting for the powder milk!”

38
00:16:10 --> 00:16:50
I’m placing the smartphone on the fixed stand and starting to make the powder milk.

39
00:16:50 --> 00:17:20
Some viewers might be wondering, “What kind of animal is a sugar glider?” If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

40
00:17:20 --> 00:18:00
This live stream started at 7 a.m. Japan time and is scheduled to end around 8 a.m. The sugar gliders in the upper cage will have a 30‐minute walk, and the ones in the lower cage will have about a 30‐minute walk too.

41
00:18:00 --> 00:18:30
Alright, I’ve prepared new powder milk. I wonder if Umi has started drinking it? Ryu also seems to want some, but since I don’t want him to gain weight, I moved him to the male cage.

42
00:18:30 --> 00:19:00
It seems the girls are a bit tired of drinking powder milk. Right now, only Yakumo is drinking it.

43
00:19:00 --> 00:19:30
It’s currently 7:20 a.m. I’ll let the walk continue for about another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, I’ll replace the pet sheet in the girls’ cage at the back of the screen.

44
00:19:30 --> 00:20:25
Today is Tuesday. Although it’s not garbage collection day in my area, I’m replacing the pet sheet to prevent odors, bacteria, and insects.

45
00:20:25 --> 00:20:35
Lately, I’ve been trying a new approach by adding my own subtitles. I write them in Japanese and then use machine translation to generate English, Chinese, and Korean subtitles. I think this is more accurate than YouTube’s automatic captions and translations.

46
00:20:35 --> 00:22:25
The cleaning of the upper cage is done. Ao, aren’t you going for a walk?

47
00:22:25 --> 00:23:23
Ten has come outside the girls’ cage and is displaying courtship behavior toward Nagi and Mitsuki. However, since Ten hasn’t been neutered, I can’t let him meet the girls.

48
00:23:23 --> 00:23:45
Ten clung to my shoulder, as if saying, “I want to see the girls too!”

49
00:23:45 --> 00:24:00
Ryu is checking the water in the male cage’s dispenser.

50
00:24:00 --> 00:24:30
Since the ones in the upper cage aren’t really walking around much, I’ll do a headcount and gradually end their walk.

51
00:24:30 --> 00:24:45
It seems Ten, who’s currently on display, still wants to walk a bit more, so I’ll let him continue a little longer.

52
00:24:45 --> 00:25:15
Ryu wants to see the girls, so before ending the walk, I’ll let them meet for a short while.

53
00:25:15 --> 00:25:50
I’ll return Yakumo, who no longer seems interested in drinking milk, to the male cage.

54
00:25:50 --> 00:26:35
I check the ones already in the male cage—Ao and Umi. Since Nagi was also there, I return Nagi to the girls’ cage and put Ryu back in the male cage.

55
00:26:35 --> 00:28:00
There’s still quite a bit of food left in the girls’ cage, so I add an apple flavor to it to stimulate their appetite.

56
00:28:00 --> 00:28:30
I want to bring back Ten, who’s still out on his walk, but he seems a bit difficult to catch.

57
00:28:30 --> 00:30:30
I’m now starting the process of making powder milk for the girls’ cage in the lower left section of our two-tiered cage.

58
00:30:30 --> 00:31:00
The camera shows Ten in the upper right, but I didn’t notice him. If Ten doesn’t come out, I plan to start the walk only for the girls in the lower left cage.

59
00:31:00 --> 00:31:15
Just then, Ten suddenly jumped out in front of me, so I caught him and placed him into the male cage in the upper right.

60
00:31:15 --> 00:32:12
Since I managed to catch Ten, I’m changing the process: first, I’ll take Yamato out of the pink basket in the lower right male cage, and then I’ll put Ten from the upper right cage into the pink basket. I do this because Yamato and Ten tend to be aggressive and end up attacking each other over the bars.

61
00:32:12 --> 00:33:00
I’ll start the morning walk in the lower cage and place the powder milk in the girls’ cage. I’ve also moved the fixed stand down so that the lower cage is in view.

62
00:33:00 --> 00:33:50
First, Rin started drinking milk. Then Tsukushi, Hayate, and Tsumugi joined in for the powder milk.

63
00:33:50 --> 00:34:20
Since the powder milk dish in the upper left girls’ cage is empty, I’ll use that dish to prepare more powder milk.

64
00:34:20 --> 00:35:20
With various sugar gliders jumping onto me, I’m not in a position to quickly make more powder milk. They might be so used to me that it’s just the scent of the powder milk they’re reacting to.

65
00:35:20 --> 00:36:00
I’m checking the cleanliness of the lower cage. The scratching post in the male cage seems to need a wash with neutral detergent, so I’m removing it.

66
00:36:00 --> 00:36:50
Shiro is wandering near the smartphone stand. Sometimes he even touches the smartphone on the stand, presses the mute button, knocks it over, or has even ended the stream. I call these kinds of disruptive actions by the sugar gliders “Sugar Glider Debuffs.”

67
00:36:50 --> 00:37:20
For now, I’m filming the upper cage with a wide-angle lens.

68
00:37:20 --> 00:38:00
Rin grabbed the dish and signaled, “There’s no more powder milk!” so I’m planning to make a new batch.

69
00:38:00 --> 00:39:00
We have a water dispenser at home, which makes preparing the powder milk simple and convenient.

70
00:39:00 --> 00:41:00
There are many sugar gliders in the lower cage who need to drink powder milk, so I make it frequently. Until I remeasure their weights around this weekend, I’m giving a serving of powder milk to those I want to help gain weight.

71
00:41:00 --> 00:42:00
I’m checking the cleanliness of the lower left girls’ cage where I put the powder milk. Since this is an animal care stream, it inevitably shows some mess. I apologize if you see any images you’d rather not see so early in the morning.

72
00:42:00 --> 00:42:30
Today’s cleaning will likely finish after replacing two more pet sheets.

73
00:42:30 --> 00:44:00
I’m not doing this animal care stream primarily to boost my subscriber count—it’s a task I have to do anyway. So I thought, why not stream it?

74
00:44:00 --> 00:44:40
I’m happy when viewers occasionally ask questions in the comments, as it gives me a chance to explain things and helps raise the profile of sugar gliders.

75
00:44:40 --> 00:46:00
However, since many of you are watching while doing other things on your smartphones, I hope that my chatter helps you learn something new, even if it’s just in the background.

76
00:46:00 --> 00:46:39
Since I’m forced to film these care videos from a distance, the screen may appear small and hard to see on smartphones. I apologize for that.

77
00:46:39 --> 00:47:00
Shiro sneaked into the area where the isolation cage had been folded and went for a walk. Even though I cleaned it thoroughly, since it was once inhabited, there might still be a lingering smell.

78
00:47:00 --> 00:47:50
There’s still some food left in the male cage, so I’ll add an apple flavor to it.

79
00:47:50 --> 00:49:00
Although the powder milk is nutritionally balanced, I believe that sugar glider food is better balanced overall, so I’d prefer they maintain their weight with the proper sugar glider food.

80
00:49:00 --> 00:49:15
If I really need to help them gain weight, I have supplements prepared. This one is a jelly-like supplement that’s high in protein—but I didn’t use it this time.

81
00:49:15 --> 00:49:30
The cleaning is now temporarily finished. The male cage is still a bit dirty, but tomorrow I’ll disassemble it and wash it with a neutral detergent.

82
00:49:30 --> 00:50:00
There’s some extra milk in the lower cage, so I’ll move some of it to the upper cage for their lunch.

83
00:50:00 --> 00:50:20
I’m now beginning the process of ending the walk in the lower cage.

84
00:50:20 --> 00:50:45
I caught Yamato and placed him in the male cage, where he’s eating food enhanced with an apple flavor.

85
00:50:45 --> 00:50:56
I moved one of the leftover powder milk dishes from the lower cage to the upper cage.

86
00:50:56 --> 00:51:10
Since Yamato is now in the cage, I took Ten out of the pink basket in the upper right cage. At that moment, Umi jumped out, so I moved him to the girls’ cage and let him have some powder milk.

87
00:51:10 --> 00:51:30
(Ao) I can’t eat my food because that pink basket is in the way!

88
00:51:30 --> 00:51:40
I removed Ten from the pink basket.

89
00:51:40 --> 00:52:10
Now I’m searching for the sugar gliders that are hiding elsewhere and need to be returned to the lower cage.

90
00:52:10 --> 00:52:40
I caught Hayate off-screen.

91
00:52:40 --> 00:53:10
At that moment, all I was thinking was, “Once I catch Shiro, we're done.” I completely forgot about Sou. I caught Sou off-stream—he was hiding in my wife’s bag.

92
00:53:10 --> 00:54:30
I’ll search while preparing for snack time. When the words “snack time” are mentioned, some sugar gliders start climbing onto the bars. This time, I’ve decided to give them dried fruits.

93
00:54:30 --> 00:55:00
While preparing for snack time, Shiro returned from his walk, so I caught him. As for Sou—I completely forgot about him.

94
00:55:00 --> 00:55:35
Normally, I’d shout “Snack Time!” to call back any who haven’t returned from their walk, but since I believe everyone’s back, I’m calling it out quietly this time.

95
00:55:35 --> 00:55:57
The male sugar gliders in the upper right are signaling, “Give us our snack quickly!”

96
00:55:57 --> 00:57:00
The girls, Nagi and Mitsuki, seem full and sleepy, and the ones in the lower cage hardly seem to be eating.

97
00:57:00 --> 00:57:50
Since Nagi and Umi wanted a snack, I gave them one. I then moved the powder milk to the lower cage.

98
00:57:50 --> 00:59:15
Final greetings: Every morning from 7 a.m. Japan time, I stream the sugar glider morning walk and care routine on YouTube and Niconico Live. If you’d like, please subscribe and give a thumbs up. See you again tomorrow at 7 a.m.

99
00:59:15 --> 01:00:08
The closing greeting image is of Ao. See you next time.
