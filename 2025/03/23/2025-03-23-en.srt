0:00:00 --> 00:01:00
Today's YouTube connection quality was not very good. There is no particular reason to use low latency, so I believe that a normal delay setting is more appropriate.

2
00:01:00 --> 00:01:30
"Good morning." It is currently 7:00 AM on Sunday in Japan.

3
00:01:30 --> 00:02:20
(Aoi, Yakumo, Umi) "I was very surprised because the room suddenly became bright!"

4
00:02:20 --> 00:02:50
It seems that Yamato spent the night in the female cage last night. As a result, the female cage ran low on food, so I moved food from the male cage to the female cage and fed it to the girls.

5
00:02:50 --> 00:04:00
I set my smartphone on a fixed stand and proceed with the work.

6
00:04:00 --> 00:04:50
I begin the morning walk of the sugar gliders in the upper cage. Their health appears to be as good as always.

7
00:04:50 --> 00:05:30
I check the dirt in the upper cage and decide which areas need cleaning.

8
00:05:30 --> 00:06:20
I start cleaning. I slept well last night, so I feel good, and the sugar gliders also seem energetic.

9
00:06:20 --> 00:07:00
(Yakumo) "Hey, Master, may I get into your clothes?"
(Note: "Master" refers to the owner.)

10
00:07:00 --> 00:07:20
Since the temperature in Japan is rising, I plan to stop using the oil heater and adjust the temperature with the air conditioner.

11
00:07:20 --> 00:07:45
(Aoi) "Master, please don't overdo it!"

12
00:07:45 --> 00:08:05
(Yakumo) "Master, don't overdo it! I'll stick my face out for you instead!"

13
00:08:05 --> 00:08:20
Every morning, several sugar gliders play inside my fleece clothing. In particular, the sugar gliders in the upper cage love my fleece.

14
00:08:20 --> 00:09:40
From the leftover food on the dish after the sugar gliders have eaten, I keep only the edible parts and discard the inedible parts (such as "Pepe Kasu") onto a pet sheet. The remaining food is then given as lunch.

15
00:09:40 --> 00:10:00
(Aoi) "I will take my walk at night, so for now, I'll groom myself in the cage."

16
00:10:00 --> 00:11:10
I begin replacing the pet sheet.

17
00:11:10 --> 00:11:20
Since no sugar gliders are currently visible on the camera, I move the smartphone stand so that the lower cage is in view.

18
00:11:20 --> 00:11:40
Before moving the camera, I capture Ryu's activity. Ryu is drinking water from the dispenser, and the bubbles in the water prove that water is being supplied properly.

19
00:11:40 --> 00:13:38
I show the lower cage. Ten from the upper cage has invaded the lower cage due to territorial disputes, and the sugar gliders in the lower cage are in a commotion.

20
00:13:38 --> 00:14:00
Aoi has started eating the remaining food.
(Aoi): "Master, now that the pet sheet replacement is finished, things have calmed down."

21
00:14:00 --> 00:16:00
Sugar gliders do not respond to human language. (By the way, cats have words to show affection to humans.)

22
00:16:00 --> 00:16:10
Since even a cleaned area can get dirty again, I re-clean any area that can be handled easily.

23
00:16:10 --> 00:17:10
I apologize that the camera sometimes captures sugar gliders making noise off-screen. In reality, several sugar gliders cling to my body and play around the room.

24
00:17:10 --> 00:17:25
To promote weight gain, and because I want to feed them milk while they are awake, I begin preparing to make powdered milk.

25
00:17:25 --> 00:17:40
Should I give milk to the girls?
(Aoi): "I think that's a good idea!"

26
00:17:40 --> 00:18:00
(The voices of the girls): "Playing with the boys is more fun than drinking milk!"

27
00:18:00 --> 00:19:00
I prepare the ingredients for making the powdered milk.

28
00:19:00 --> 00:19:25
I am getting flustered because I can’t find the ingredients for the powdered milk.

29
00:19:25 --> 00:20:00
I found them. I will use the powdered milk from “Pet Shop Kojima.” Details are provided in the description.

30
00:20:00 --> 00:21:18
I go to the next room to get a small dish. There are also sugar gliders accompanying me.

31
00:21:18 --> 00:21:30
I return with a small glass dish and a teaspoon. Now, I begin making the powdered milk.

32
00:21:30 --> 00:22:00
I also intend to give powdered milk to Umi.
(Aoi): "Aren't I getting any?"

33
00:22:00 --> 00:23:35
Since Umi wants to drink the powdered milk quickly, I keep her waiting in the girls’ cage.

34
00:23:35 --> 00:23:50
Here is the powdered milk I made.
(Nagi): "I’m fine with the leftover food instead."

35
00:23:50 --> 00:24:00
(Umi): "The powdered milk is delicious!"
(Nagi): "Huh?"

36
00:24:00 --> 00:25:00
I close the door of the girls' cage and search for one more female.

37
00:25:00 --> 00:27:30
I use the smartphone on the fixed stand to look for Mitsuki. If she is out walking, I will let her continue and feed her later. I also move the stand to a place where her milk-drinking is clearly visible.

38
00:27:30 --> 00:28:50
I found Mitsuki, so I feed her milk.

39
00:28:50 --> 00:29:30
I am feeding milk to the girls and Umi because recent weight measurements showed that some sugar gliders have lost weight.

40
00:29:30 --> 00:30:20
Mitsuki, who appears on the right side of the screen, has particularly lost weight because she just gave birth.

41
00:30:20 --> 00:31:00
I think it’s time to wrap up the work with the sugar gliders in the upper cage.

42
00:31:00 --> 00:32:00
Since the milk in the upper cage has been completely consumed, I will prepare some more.
(Umi): "We're out of milk!"

43
00:32:00 --> 00:32:30
In the lower cage, since Yamato has lost weight and the females have slightly decreased in weight, I plan to feed milk in the lower girls’ cage too.

44
00:32:30 --> 00:34:00
I have prepared additional milk for Umi and her companions, so I will now conclude the morning walk in the upper cage.

45
00:34:00 --> 00:34:30
I cannot find Yakumo.

46
00:34:30 --> 00:35:40
First, I will take Yamato out of the pink basket in the lower cage and put Ten, from the upper cage, into the pink basket. I would be glad if I find Yakumo during this process.

47
00:35:40 --> 00:36:20
Since Yamato and Yakumo tend to fight, I will let only the females go for a walk in the lower cage. (Although Yakumo is male, he rarely fights with the females.)

48
00:36:20 --> 00:36:50
Yamato is showing courtship behavior toward Tsukushi. Their relationship is almost like that of a grandfather and his granddaughter.
(Tsukushi): "No! Tch!" [warning sound]

49
00:36:50 --> 00:37:50
I place the smartphone back on the stand and resume the search for Yakumo.

50
00:37:50 --> 00:39:00
Depending on the situation, I might feed Yamato the powdered milk first.

51
00:39:00 --> 00:40:00
One reason for planning this broadcast to last about one hour is that sugar gliders are nocturnal and tend to start sleeping around 8:00. Another reason is that about 30 minutes of exercise is sufficient for them.

52
00:40:00 --> 00:40:55
I have mistaken Yakumo and Tsumugi several times because these two are almost identical in build and fur. However, Yakumo is male and Tsumugi is female.

53
00:40:55 --> 00:41:30
Since there is no alternative, I go to the next room to get a new small dish and then return to feed Yamato and the females. I will be away for a short while.

54
00:41:30 --> 00:43:00
Since Aoi being on the screen is getting a bit boring, I adjust the camera so that the entire cage is in view.

55
00:43:00 --> 00:44:10
After this broadcast, a short video is scheduled to be published on the night of March 23, 2025. The audio uses the currently trending internet meme "Eho Eho," which includes the line "Everyone except humans has a cat’s tongue." I also plan to let the powdered milk cool slightly before feeding it.

56
00:44:10 --> 00:44:20
Since there was some leftover milk from the females in the upper cage, I give the remaining milk to the females in the lower cage.

57
00:44:20 --> 00:45:20
I record the sugar gliders as they drink milk.

58
00:45:20 --> 00:46:00
While Yamato is focused on drinking milk, I remove Ten from the pink basket in the upper cage.

59
00:46:00 --> 00:46:20
Currently, there are four sugar gliders drinking milk.

60
00:46:20 --> 00:46:55
Unfortunately, Sou and Hayate in the male cage are not going out for a walk and have not been given milk. This is because opening the cage now might cause a fight with Yakumo.

61
00:46:55 --> 00:48:00
I continue searching for Yakumo.

62
00:48:00 --> 00:48:45
It seems that Rin is hiding inside a box where towels are stored, so I catch her and feed her milk in the girls’ cage.

63
00:48:45 --> 00:49:40
Even so, I am unable to find Yakumo.

64
00:49:40 --> 00:50:00
"I can't find Yakumo; what do you think we should do, Aoi?"
(Aoi): "I don't know!"

65
00:50:00 --> 00:51:10
I heard a noise somewhere in the room, so I go to investigate that area.

66
00:51:10 --> 00:51:25
I have, for now, found Yakumo. I will now begin the capture process.

67
00:51:25 --> 00:51:42
I have successfully captured Yakumo!

68
00:51:42 --> 00:52:30
Although it is not an ideal time for a walk, I take the male(s) from the lower cage, who haven't been able to walk at all, out of the cage after a light wipe-down. The two that dash out will be captured off-camera.

69
00:52:30 --> 00:54:00
For the ongoing work, I have placed the smartphone on a fixed stand. I am currently busy with cleaning and making powdered milk.

70
00:54:00 --> 00:55:00
I aim to increase their weight by feeding them milk rather than treats. I am considering their nutritional balance, and treats are merely optional.

71
00:55:00 --> 00:56:00
Hayate is licking the teaspoon that was used to make the powdered milk.

72
00:56:00 --> 00:57:00
In the girls’ cage, a milk-drinking contest is taking place.

73
00:57:00 --> 00:58:20
Based on the weight measurements, there might be a need to create a "weight-loss room" for individuals who need to lose weight, but it does not seem necessary this time.

74
00:58:20 --> 00:58:40
I plan to capture Sou and Hayate off-camera.

75
00:58:40 --> 01:01:40
I start preparing for snack time. I will serve fish sticks as the treat. The fish sticks are made from dried fish.

76
01:01:40 --> 01:03:46
This is the closing greeting. This broadcast is being streamed on YouTube in vertical format and on NicoNico Live. Later, the archive will be re-edited and re-uploaded as a horizontal video with additional information. If you like it, please give a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel. The sugar gliders shown at the end today are Shiro and Tsukushi. Now, I will play the ending.
